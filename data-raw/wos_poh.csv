Two hypotheses are tested: (1) Can changes in attitudes be accounted for by the changing demographics of the population? (2) Are changing attitudes toward homosexuality embedded within larger cultural ideological shifts? The data indicate that Americans distinguish between the morality of homosexuality and the civil liberties of homosexuals. Americans became increasingly negative regarding the morality of homosexuality through 1990, but since then their attitudes have become increasingly liberal. The same 25-year period witnessed a steady decline in Americans' willingness to restrict the civil libel-ties of homosexuals. Changes in American demographics-particularly increasing educational levels-and changing cultural ideological beliefs can account for only about one-half of the change over time in attitudes toward homosexuality. Several theories are put forth to explain these patterns of change and the distinction made between morality and civil liberties.","Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Loftus, J (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Ballantine Hall 744, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,,,,,,,51,490,490,0,102,AMER SOCIOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"1307 NEW YORK AVE NW #700, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-4712 USA",0003-1224,,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

Attitudes toward lesbians differed from attitudes toward gay men in several areas, and significant differences were observed between male and female heterosexual respondents. Survey participants generally were more likely to regard gay men as mentally ill, supported adoption rights for lesbians more than for gay men, and had more negative personal reactions to gay men than to lesbians. Overall, heterosexual women were more supportive than men of employment protection and adoption rights for gay people, more willing to extend employee benefits to same-sex couples, and less likely to hold stereotypical beliefs about gay people. Heterosexual men's negative reactions to gay men were at the root of these gender differences. Of all respondent-by-target combinations, heterosexual men were the least supportive of recognition of same-sex relationships and adoption rights for gay men, most likely to believe that gay men are mentally ill and molest children, and most negative in their affective reactions to gay men. Heterosexual men's response patterns were affected by item order, suggesting possible gender differences in the cognitive organization of attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. The findings demonstrate the importance of differentiating lesbians from gay men as attitude targets in survey research.","Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Herek, GM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Psychol, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,"Herek, Gregory M/F-9856-2011",,,,,,49,451,457,1,95,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0033-362X,,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

Using national surveys and advances in opinion estimation, we create new estimates of state-level support for eight policies, including civil unions and nondiscrimination laws. We differentiate between responsiveness to opinion and congruence with opinion majorities. We find a high degree of responsiveness, controlling for interest group pressure and the ideology of voters and elected officials. Policy salience strongly increases the influence of policy-specific opinion (directly and relative to general voter ideology). There is, however, a surprising amount of noncongruence-for some policies, even clear supermajority support seems insufficient for adoption. When noncongruent, policy tends to be more conservative than desired by voters; that is, there is little progay policy bias. We find little to no evidence that state political institutions affect policy responsiveness or congruence.","[Lax, Jeffrey R.; Phillips, Justin H.] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Lax, JR (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 7th Floor,Int Affairs Bldg,420 W 118th St, New York, NY 10027 USA.",JRL2124@columbia.edu; JHP2121@columbia.edu,,,,,,,44,371,371,0,105,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Feeling thermometer ratings of transgender people were strongly correlated with attitudes toward gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals, but were significantly less favorable. Attitudes toward transgender people were more negative among heterosexual men than women. Negative attitudes were associated with endorsement of a binary conception of gender; higher levels of psychological authoritarianism, political conservatism, and anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity; and lack of personal contact with sexual minorities. In regression analysis, sexual prejudice accounted for much of the variance in transgender attitudes, but respondent gender, educational level, authoritarianism, anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity remained significant predictors with sexual prejudice statistically controlled.

Religion is often seen as an important predictor of attitudes about homosexuality. However, cross-national differences in cultural orientations suggest that the role religion has in explaining homosexual attitudes may depend on a nation's cultural context. In this study, we merge ideas from cultural sociology and religious contextual effects to explain cross-national variation in public opinion about homosexuality. Using data from the fourth wave of the World Values Survey and Hierarchical Modeling techniques, we find support for the micro and macro effects of religion and a survival vs. self-expressive cultural orientation. Moreover, we find that personal religious beliefs have a greater effect on attitudes about homosexuality in countries like the United States, which have a strong self-expressive cultural orientation.

The goal of this article is to analyze the relationship between religion, measured in terms of religious affiliation and religiosity, and public opinion about same-sex marriage, civil unions, and a federal constitutional amendment that would prohibit gay marriage. Methods. We use logistic regression with calculated standardized coefficients to analyze data from a nationally representative survey of 1,610 respondents conducted in March-April 2004. Results. Religious variables perform better than demographic measures in models of attitudes about same-sex unions. Non-Protestants are much more likely to support same-sex unions than are Protestants, and individuals with conservative attitudes toward morality and secularism and (to a lesser extent) those who participate actively in religious life are more likely to oppose such unions. On the whole, religious variables play a weaker role in predicting support for a constitutional amendment to prevent gay marriage than they do in predicting attitudes toward same-sex unions. Conclusion. Religious variables play powerful roles in structuring attitudes about same-sex unions. Moreover, homosexuality appears to be a major component of the moral values discourse that is currently so popular in American politics.","Clemson Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; Bowdoin Coll, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Clemson University; Bowdoin College; Harvard University,"Olson, LR (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",laurao@clemson.edu,,,,,,,56,311,312,0,140,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4941,1540-6237,,SOC SCI QUART,Soc.

We show that policy is highly responsive to policy-specific opinion, even controlling for other influences. But we also uncover a striking democratic deficit: policy is congruent with majority will only half the time. The analysis considers the influence of institutions, salience, partisan control of government, and interest groups on the magnitude and ideological direction of this democratic deficit. We find the largest influences to be legislative professionalization, term limits, and issue salience. Partisanship and interest groups affect the ideological balance of incongruence more than the aggregate degree thereof.

Yet evidence that blacks are more homophobic than whites is quite limited. This article uses responses from almost seven thousand blacks and forty-three thousand whites in 31 surveys conducted since 1973 to give more definitive answers on black-white attitudinal differences and their demographic roots. Despite their greater disapproval of homosexuality, blacks' opinions on sodomy laws, gay civil liberties, and employment discrimination are quite similar to whites' opinions, and African Americans are more likely to support laws prohibiting antigay discrimination. Once religious and educational differences are controlled, blacks remain more disapproving of homosexuality but are moderately more supportive of gay civil liberties and markedly more opposed to antigay employment discrimination than are whites. Yet religion, education, gender, and age all have weaker impacts on black than on white attitudes, suggesting that black and white attitudes have different roots.","Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Publ Adm & Urban Studies, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Lewis, GB (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Publ Adm & Urban Studies, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",,,,,,,,69,273,274,2,66,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0033-362X,,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

We present the first systematic assessment of the predictive accuracy of each and give practical advice about when and how each method should be used. To do so, we use an original data set of over 100 surveys on gay rights issues as well as 1988 presidential election data. Under optimal conditions, both methods work well, but multilevel modeling performs better generally. Compared to baseline opinion measures, it yields smaller errors, higher correlations, and more reliable estimates. Multilevel modeling is clearly superior when samples are smaller-indeed, one can accurately estimate state opinion using only a single large national survey.

It provides evidence that tolerance tends to decline as national income inequality rises. For professionals and managers, the results also support the postmaterialist argument that economic development leads to more tolerant attitudes. On the other hand, attitudes of the working class are generally less tolerant, and contrary to expectations of the postmaterialist thesis, are seemingly unaffected by economic development. In other words, economic development influences attitudes only for those who benefit most. These findings have political implications, suggesting that state policies that have the goal of economic growth but fail to consider economic inequality may contribute to intolerant social and political values, an attribute widely considered detrimental for the health of democracy.","[Andersen, Robert] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 2J4, Canada; [Fetner, Tina] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada",University of Toronto; McMaster University,"Andersen, R (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, 725 Spadina Ave, Toronto, ON M5S 2J4, Canada.",bob.andersen@utoronto.ca; tina.fetner@mcmaster.ca,"Fetner, Tina/AAW-9246-2020","Fetner, Tina/0000-0003-4073-073X",,,,,68,226,228,4,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0092-5853,1540-5907,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

If the cause of homosexuality is perceived as controllable (learned, environmental, or an individual choice), negative affect toward homosexuals and reduced support for policies relevant to the group can be expected. If the cause is perceived as uncontrollable (biological or genetic in origin), positive affect and increased support for polices is anticipated. Our analyses of data from two unique surveys of national adults corroborate these hypotheses, showing that positive feelings toward gays, support for gay civil rights, civil unions, and same-sex marriage are strongly determined by a genetic attribution for homosexuality. Attributions are in fact the strongest predictor of support.

Using OLS regression and decomposition techniques to analyze General Social Survey data, I explain individuals' attitudes toward same-sex marriage from 1988 to 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010. The influences on same-sex marriage attitudes differed substantially over time. Many of the characteristics commonly thought to increase opposition to same-sex marriage (including being African American, living in the southern United States, being an evangelical Protestant, and being Republican) are associated with attitudes only in the later years. In 1988, opposition was generally much higher for everyone; most respondents expressed at least some to strong disapproval of same-sex marriage in 1988, which was then reduced for the highly educated, urban residents, and those with less conservative or no religious affiliations. That is, support for same-sex marriage was fairly localized to specific subgroups in 1988. But, by 2010, support for same-sex marriage was much more broad-based, and opposition to same-sex marriage became more localized to specific subgroupsolder Americans, southerners, African Americans, evangelical Protestants, and Republicans. The decomposition analysis finds that changing same-sex marriage attitudes are not due to demographic changes in the American population. Rather, the liberalization in same-sex marriage attitudes from 1988 to 2010 is due primarily to a general societal change in attitudes, as is evidenced by the large change in the constant. Taken together, the results suggest that changing attitudes toward same-sex marriage reflect a cultural shift.","Georgia State Univ, Dept Sociol, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Baunach, DM (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Dept Sociol, POB 5020, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",dbaunach@gsu.edu,,"Baunach, Dawn Michelle/0000-0003-4848-3219",,,,,27,192,192,3,119,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0033-362X,1537-5331,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

One possibility is that shifts in the aggregate levels of predispositions such as egalitarianism, moral traditionalism, feelings toward gays and lesbians, partisanship, and ideology produced changes in policy opinions. Another possibility is that shifts in the underlying structure of opinion-that is, shifts in the how citizens used these predispositions to think about the issue-produced changes in support for gay rights.

We studied reactions to the June 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage. In a controlled experimental setting, we found that a favorable ruling, when presented as likely, shifted perceived norms and personal attitudes toward increased support for gay marriage and gay people. Next, a five-wave longitudinal time-series study using a sample of 1,063 people found an increase in perceived social norms supporting gay marriage after the ruling but no change in personal attitudes. This pattern was replicated in a separate between-subjects data set. These findings provide the first experimental evidence that an institutional decision can change perceptions of social norms, which have been shown to guide behavior, even when individual opinions are unchanged.","[Tankard, Margaret E.] RAND Corp, Behav & Policy Sci Dept, 1776 Main St, Santa Monica, CA 90401 USA; [Paluck, Elizabeth Levy] Princeton Univ, Dept Psychol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Paluck, Elizabeth Levy] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA",RAND Corporation; Princeton University; Princeton University,"Tankard, ME (corresponding author), RAND Corp, Behav & Policy Sci Dept, 1776 Main St, Santa Monica, CA 90401 USA.",mtankard@rand.org,,,,,,,38,171,172,9,54,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0956-7976,1467-9280,,PSYCHOL SCI,Psychol.

An analysis of mass media coverage during the peak years of the debate over gay rights (1990-97) showed that the implications of moral traditionalism were virtually undisputed in this debate, whereas both sides laid claim to egalitarianism. Analysis of American National Election Studies survey data demonstrated that in 1992 and 1996 the impact of moral traditionalism on public opinion grew stronger as political knowledge increased, whereas the impact of egalitarianism did not vary across levels of knowledge. Thus, the results suggest that the extent to which political knowledge moderates a value's effect on opinion can depend on whether public debate provides an undisputed frame or competing frames for that value. One could, in turn, frame the implications of this finding for democratic politics in more than one way.","George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Brewer, PR (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 2201 G St NW,Suite 507, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",,,,,,,,35,158,159,0,37,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0033-362X,,,PUBLIC OPIN QUART,Public Opin.

Against this background, the second section analyses citizens' attitudes towards homosexuality and whether there are differences among the 27 EU member states and Turkey. The descriptive findings show that there are substantial differences at the national and individual level in the degree to which citizens think of homosexuality as acceptable. A sense that homosexuality is justifiable is particularly low in recently acceded countries and is almost non-existent in Turkey. Modernization theorists have argued that economic development influences the value orientation of the citizens. Other scholars have claimed that values are strongly influenced by the religious heritage of a country. Using multilevel analysis, the study tests to what extent modernization factors and/or religious factors influence citizens' attitudes towards non-discrimination of homosexuality. According to the results of the causal analysis, modernization theory and cultural heritage theory contribute to explaining attitudes towards homosexuality.

Data were collected using a structured social support network matrix in a community sample recruited in New York City. Our findings show that gay and bisexual men may rely on chosen families more than lesbian and bisexual women. Both heterosexuals and LGBs relied less on family and more on other people (e.g., friends, coworkers) for everyday social support (e.g., recreational and social activities, talking about problems). Providers of everyday social support were most often of the same sexual orientation and race/ethnicity as participants. In seeking major support (e.g., borrowing large sums of money), heterosexual men and women along with lesbian and bisexual women relied primarily on their families, but gay and bisexual men relied primarily on other LGB individuals. Racial/ethnic minority LGBs relied on LGB similar others at the same rate as did White LGBs but, notably, racial/ethnic minority LGBs reported receiving fewer dimensions of support.","[Frost, David M.; Schwartz, Sharon] Columbia Univ, Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Meyer, Ilan H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Williams Inst, Los Angeles, CA USA",Columbia University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Frost, DM (corresponding author), Univ Surrey, Sch Psychol, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.",d.frost@surrey.ac.uk,"Frost, David M/A-8765-2009; Meyer, Ilan H/A-2142-2009","Frost, David/0000-0001-9284-5219",NIMH NIH HHS [R01 MH066058] Funding Source: Medline,NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)),,,89,129,135,7,45,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",0002-9432,1939-0025,,AM J ORTHOPSYCHIAT,Am.

However, few studies have examined structural stigma related to sexual minority status as a risk factor for HIV outcomes among MSM.Methods:In August 2013, members of a large MSM social and sexual networking site in the United States completed a survey about HIV-prevention practices. A previously validated composite index provided values for state-level structural stigma, including density of same-sex couples, proportion of public high schools with Gay-Straight Alliances, state laws protecting sexual minorities, and public opinion toward homosexuality. Multivariable logistic generalized estimating equations assessed the relationship between structural stigma and condomless anal intercourse, use and awareness of antiretroviral-based HIV-prevention strategies (i.e. pre and postexposure prophylaxis, or PEP and PrEP), and comfort discussing male-male sex with primary care providers.Results:Among the 4098 HIV-uninfected MSM, lower state-level structural stigma was associated with decreased odds of condomless anal intercourse [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.97 per one unit increase in structural stigma score, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-0.99], increased odds of awareness of PEP (aOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.09), and PrEP (aOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10), having taken PEP (aOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.05-1.26) and PrEP (aOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01-1.44), and comfort discussing male-male sex with providers (aOR 1.08, 95% CI 1.05-1.11), after adjusting for social and state-level confounders.Conclusion:MSM living in more stigmatizing environments had decreased use of antiretroviral-based HIV-prevention strategies compared to those in less stigmatizing environments. Legal reforms protecting sexual minorities should be evaluated as structural interventions that could reduce HIV risk among MSM.","[Oldenburg, Catherine E.; Mimiaga, Matthew J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Perez-Brumer, Amaya G.; Hatzenbuehler, Mark L.] Columbia Mailman Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Sociomed Sci, New York, NY USA; [Krakower, Douglas; Mayer, Kenneth H.] Beth Israel Deaconess Med Ctr, Div Infect Dis, Dept Internal Med, Cambridge, MA USA; [Novak, David S.] Online Buddies Inc, OLB Res Inst, Cambridge, MA USA; [Mimiaga, Matthew J.; Mayer, Kenneth H.] Fenway Community Hlth, Fenway Inst, Boston, MA USA; [Mimiaga, Matthew J.] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Dept Psychiat, Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Mayer, Kenneth H.] Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth & Populat, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

No study to date contains a comprehensive collection of religion measures while also accounting for views of the cause of homosexuality. Therefore, this study investigates the extent to which religion predicts certain attribution beliefs as well as attitudes toward same-sex unions while controlling for attribution beliefs. Method The Baylor Religion Survey (2007) is used to estimate binary logistic models predicting the effects of religion and attribution beliefs on attitudes toward same-sex unions. Findings First, religion is strongly associated with the belief that homosexuals choose their sexual orientation. Second, religion maintains a significant association with attitudes toward same-sex unions despite inclusion of an attribution variable. Conclusion Even if a biological explanation for homosexuality is ultimately proven, unfavorable attitudes toward same-sex unions will most likely endure due to religion's persistent effect.","Baylor Univ, Dept Sociol, Waco, TX 76798 USA",Baylor University,"Whitehead, AL (corresponding author), Baylor Univ, Dept Sociol, 1 Bear Pl,Box 97326, Waco, TX 76798 USA.",Andrew_Whitehead@Baylor.edu,"Whitehead, Andrew/AAH-3725-2019; Whitehead, Andrew/AAG-1046-2020","Whitehead, Andrew/0000-0001-6587-0996",,,,,46,103,103,2,37,"WILEY-BLACKWELL PUBLISHING, INC",MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0038-4941,,,SOC SCI QUART,Soc.

From California to Missouri, nearly all states now face legislative challenges to the once firmly entrenched notion that marriage can only exist between a man and a woman. Public opinion polls conducted from 1977 to 2004 found that Americans' attitudes toward gay men and lesbians and marriages or civil unions for same-gender couples have evolved. Opposition persists, however. The most recent data indicate support for some legal recognition of gay and lesbian couples, but most Americans favor civil unions over same-gender marriages. Although the future of civil unions and same-gender marriages remains uncertain, social workers can serve gay and lesbian clients and their families best by staying informed of the attendant legal, social, and policy issues.","Arizona State Univ, Sch Social Work, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; Arizona State Univ, Sch Social Work, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Avery, A (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Social Work, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",Darrel.Montero@asu.edu,,,,,,,28,98,98,0,39,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0037-8046,1545-6846,,SOC WORK,Soc.

In most of the literature, declining levels of prejudice toward homosexuality are found to result from structural social processes (rising education, secularization, and detraditionalization), which should occur in all industrialized societies, with or without same-sex marriage. In this article, we analyze data of the five waves of the European Social Survey for the period 2002-2010. Results show that levels of prejudice are significantly lower in countries that recognize same-sex marriage, while levels are only slightly lower in countries with some form of registered partnership for gay and lesbian couples.

If lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals (LGBs) come out primarily to people they expect to be accepting, however, the repeated finding that people who know LGBs are more likely to support gay rights could be overstating the impact of coming out. Using individual-level data from 27 national surveys, I find that similar variables predict both knowing LGBs and supporting gay rights, but in different ways. Even after controlling for those demographic, religious, and political variables-and sometimes also for beliefs about whether some people are born gay and whether homosexuality is immoral-people who know LGBs are much more likely to support gay rights. The effect holds for every issue, in every year, for every type of relationship, and for every demographic, religious, and political subgroup.","[Lewis, Gregory B.] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Lewis, GB (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",,,,,,,,44,93,93,0,29,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0190-292X,,,POLICY STUD J,Policy Stud.

The results show that participants who received an equality frame were particularly likely to explain their views on gay rights in terms of equality and that participants who received a morality frame were particularly likely to cast their opinions in the language of morality.

Results indicated framing effects that were, in all cases, contingent on the ideological leanings of the group. The marriage frame tended to polarize group discussions along ideological lines.

Our results suggest that although partisan elites have become increasingly polarized on culture war issues, mass partisans have not followed suit across all issues. Only on environmental and gun control issues do we find significant evidence of issue evolution, including a linkage between elite and mass opinion.

To help address this issue, we offer a conceptualization of formal rights and informal privileges. Using original data from a nationally representative survey experiment, we examine whether people distinguish between formal rights (e.g., partnership benefits) and informal privileges (e.g., public displays of affection) in their attitudes toward same-sex couples. Results show that heterosexuals are as willing to extend formal rights to same-sex couples as they are to unmarried heterosexual couples. However, they are less willing to grant informal privileges. Lesbians and gays are more willing to extend formal rights to same-sex couples, but they too are sometimes more supportive of informal privileges for heterosexual couples. We also find that heterosexuals' attitudes toward marriage more closely align with their attitudes toward informal privileges than formal rights, whereas lesbians and gays view marriage similarly to both formal rights and informal privileges. Our findings highlight the need to examine multiple dimensions of sexual prejudice to help understand how informal types of prejudice persist as minority groups receive formal rights.","[Doan, Long; Loehr, Annalise; Miller, Lisa R.] Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Doan, L (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Sociol, 744 Ballantine Hall, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",longdoan@indiana.edu,"Doan, Long/AAY-3303-2021","Doan, Long/0000-0001-9875-1037",,,,,84,86,86,1,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-1224,1939-8271,,AM SOCIOL REV,Am.

Three broad sets of indicators are examined: general attitudes toward homosexuality; acceptability of homosexuals in particular roles; and attitudes toward homosexual rights. Opinion was overwhelmingly negative in the 1940s and 1950s but started to liberalize following the decriminalization of homosexuality in 1967. Attitudes suffered a temporary setback with the advent of AIDS in the mid-1980s, but the thaw resumed from the early 1990s and accelerated following the millennium, especially during the second half of the first decade of the 2000s, culminating in the successful campaign for legalization of same-sex marriage in England and Wales.

Although all groups of Californians say that they have become more accepting of homosexual relations since they turned 18, the pattern is strongest for liberals, Democrats, and the less religious. These groups have also become much more supportive of same-sex marriage, while conservatives, Republicans, Protestants, and AfricanAmericans appear at least as opposed today as they were two decades ago.","[Lewis, Gregory B.] Georgia State Univ, Publ Adm & Urban Studies, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Gossett, Charles W.] Calif State Polytech Univ Pomona, Polit Sci Dept, Pomona, CA 91768 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; California State University System; California State Polytechnic University Pomona,"Lewis, GB (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Publ Adm & Urban Studies, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",,"Gossett, Charles W/C-8661-2011",,Social Science Research and Instructional Council of the California State University System,Social Science Research and Instructional Council of the California State University System,"We would like to thank the Social Science Research and Instructional Council of the California State University System for a Field Institute Faculty Fellowship, which enabled the placement of questions on one of the Field Polls.

These policies are often developed in the legislative process, which directly involve public opinion. To date, there is only one study analyzing American public attitudes toward transgender people. This research gap makes it unclear whether people in general understand what transgender means and whether public support for transgender rights depends on understanding and knowing transgender people. Since the population of transgender people is estimated to be smaller than that of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people, examining whether and how having a friend or family member who is lesbian or gay relates to transgender rights is important to understand political coalitions and attitude change. This study examines public attitudes about transgender rights in the USA. It finds that as respondents report being more informed about transgender people they tend to have more supportive attitudes. Interpersonal contact with someone who is lesbian or gay also leads to a secondary transfer of positive attitudes. About half of the secondary transfer effect operates through a mechanism of attitude generalization: contact positively affects the opinions people have on gay rights that then broaden to affect attitudes on transgender rights. Demographic characteristics also indicate that predictors of transgender attitudes are similar to previous studies regarding attitudes toward lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals. Further survey efforts need to consider inquiring about transgender rights and attitudes, as this remains a research gap in need of scholarly understanding.","UCLA Sch Law, Williams Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",,"Flores, AR (corresponding author), UCLA Sch Law, Williams Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",flores@law.ucla.edu,"Flores, Andrew R./AAU-9931-2020","Flores, Andrew/0000-0003-3285-9488",,,,,60,85,85,1,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2156-5503,2156-5511,,POLIT GROUPS IDENTIT,Polit.

As we expected, age was a relevant predictor of negative attitudes towards lesbian and gay parenting: older elders had a stronger prejudice than the others. Data revealed that the more positive evaluation was for the heterosexual and lesbian parents while the more negative evaluation was for the gay male parents. Regression analyses showed that a negative attitude towards lesbian and gay parents was predicted by older age, right-wing conservatism, and internalized sexual stigma. The expected effects on child outcomes were predicted only by the dimensions of sexual stigma.","[Baiocco, Roberto] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Fac Med & Psychol, Dept Dev & Social Psychol, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Nardelli, Nicola; Pezzuti, Lina; Lingiardi, Vittorio] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Dynam & Clin Psychol, I-00185 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; Sapienza University Rome,"Baiocco, R (corresponding author), Univ Roma La Sapienza, Fac Med & Psychol, Dept Dev & Social Psychol, Via Marsi 78, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",roberto.baiocco@uniroma1.it,"Nardelli, Nicola/O-6397-2018; Baiocco, Roberto/B-2728-2010","Nardelli, Nicola/0000-0002-4660-0349; Baiocco, Roberto/0000-0002-6372-3762; LINGIARDI, Vittorio/0000-0002-1298-3935; Pezzuti, Lina/0000-0001-5810-4185",,,,,36,79,79,0,33,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-9884,1553-6610,,SEX RES SOC POLICY,Sex.

The previous literature indicates that attitudes may change, but there is some debate about its direction. According to some theories, legislation or litigation should strike a backlash, resulting in greater disapproval of the issue. Other perspectives contend that these acts reflect consensus, legitimate, or polarize the issue. We analyze panel data on attitudes toward same-sex marriage and feelings toward lesbians and gay men. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court made historic decisions on same-sex marriage, and residents in some states had same-sex marriage legalized. Given this variation, we decompose the multiple pathways attitudes change among residents in different policy contexts over time. We find that residents of states that had same-sex marriage policy introduced had the greatest reduction of anti-gay attitudes. We consider consensus and legitimacy as most applicable and provide minimal indication of backlash or polarization.","[Flores, Andrew R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Box 951476, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Barclay, Scott] Drexel Univ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Drexel University,"Flores, AR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Box 951476, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;Flores, AR (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Law, Williams Inst, Box 951476, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",flores@law.ucla.edu,"Flores, Andrew R./AAU-9931-2020","Flores, Andrew/0000-0003-3285-9488",,,,,94,77,78,0,59,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1065-9129,1938-274X,,POLIT RES QUART,Polit.

For decades, scholars have suggested that opinion backlash impedes policy gains by marginalized groups. Public opinion research, however, suggests that widespread attitude change that backlash proponents theorize is likely to be rare. Examining backlash against gays and lesbians using a series of online and natural experiments about marriage equality, and large-sample survey data, we find no evidence of opinion backlash among the general public, by members of groups predisposed to dislike gays and lesbians, or from those with psychological traits that may predispose them to lash back. The important implication is that groups pursuing rights should not be dissuaded by threats of backlash that will set their movement back in the court of public opinion.","[Bishin, Benjamin G.] Univ Calif Riverside, Polit Sci, 2221 Watkins Hall,900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Hayes, Thomas J.] Univ Connecticut, Polit Sci, 365 Fairfield Way,U-1024, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Incantalupo, Matthew B.] Princeton Univ, Polit & Social Policy, Corwin Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Smith, Charles Anthony] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Polit Sci, Polit Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside; University of Connecticut; Princeton University; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Bishin, BG (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Polit Sci, 2221 Watkins Hall,900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",ben.bishin@ucr.edu; thomas.hayes@uconn.edu; mincanta@princeton.edu; casmith@uci.edu,"Hayes, Thomas/AAK-5152-2020","Hayes, Thomas/0000-0002-1837-0857","Center for the Study of Democracy at the University of California, Irvine","Center for the Study of Democracy at the University of California, Irvine(University of California System)","Replication files for this study can be found at the AJPS Data Archive on Dataverse (global id doi:10.7910/DVN/28640).

It addresses three interrelated questions: how many out LGBT legislators have served in national parliaments, what explains the cross-national variation in their legislative presence, and what is the relationship between the presence of gay legislators and the enactment of laws that treat gay and straight citizens equally? There is an established literature arguing that the representation of women and ethnic minorities descriptively in national legislatures improves the realization of their policy preferences and the position of the group within the society as a whole. This article draws on that literature and extends the analysis to LGBT communities. It finds that the presence of even a small number of openly gay legislators is associated significantly with the future passage of enhanced gay rights, even after including controls for social values, democracy, government ideology, and electoral system design. Once openly gay legislators are in office they have a transformative effect on the views and voting behavior of their straight colleagues. This familiarity through presence effect is echoed in studies of U.S. state legislatures and levels of social tolerance of homosexuality in the population at large.","Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Reynolds, A (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",,,,,,,,104,71,71,1,66,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0003-0554,1537-5943,,AM POLIT SCI REV,Am.

Using a unique panel study conducted immediately before and after the court decision, we evaluate the impact of policy adoption on changing opinions on minority rights. The signaling of new social norms pressured some respondents to modify their expressed attitudes. We find that respondents whose demographic characteristics would predict support for marriage equality, but previously did not, were more likely to shift their opinions to be consistent with the new state law. A policy feedback mechanism may be responsible for the rapid diffusion of laws legalizing same-sex in the states.","[Kreitzer, Rebecca J.; Tolbert, Caroline J.] Univ Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Hamilton, Allison J.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Polit Sci, Chattanooga, TN USA",University of Iowa; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee at Chattanooga,"Tolbert, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Iowa, Dept Polit Sci, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",caroline-tolbert@uiowa.edu,"Kreitzer, Rebecca/H-8316-2019",,,,,,55,69,69,1,53,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1065-9129,1938-274X,,POLIT RES QUART,Polit.

Data from two nationally representative surveys conducted in December of 1985 (N = 2,308) and in July of 1987 (N = 2,095) provide evidence that misinformation about AIDS transmission and negative attitudes toward homosexuals are strong predictors of support for stringent restrictions of persons with AIDS.

Methods Using linear decomposition techniques, I explain the change in attitudes toward gay marriage from 1988 to 2006. Results Attitudes significantly liberalized over time; 71 percent opposed gay marriage in 1988, but by 2006, this figure dropped to 52 percent. Approximately two-thirds of this change was due to an intracohort change effect, or individuals' modifying their views over time, and one-third was due to a cohort succession effect, or later cohorts replacing earlier ones. This pattern was replicated across many subgroups of the U.S. public, including age, sex, residential, educational, and religious groups. Conclusion The results suggest that the use of the equality/tolerance framing of gay marriage by its supporters and other societal events or moments may have convinced some people who used to disapprove of gay marriage in 1988 to approve of it by 2006.","Georgia State Univ, Dept Sociol, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Baunach, DM (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Dept Sociol, POB 5020, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",dbaunach@gsu.edu,,"Baunach, Dawn Michelle/0000-0003-4848-3219",,,,,29,67,67,0,55,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0038-4941,,,SOC SCI QUART,Soc.

Evangelical gender attitudes regarding work and family issues are more conservative than those of all other groups, but are adaptive to broad trends, changing at a rate similar to those of other groups. Evangelical attitudes toward the morality of homosexuality and same-sex marriage are more conservative than those of all other religious groups, and their rate of change is slower over time. Separate trends on the two issues suggest that gender and sexuality attitude change is decoupled, especially among evangelicals who are adapting more on gender while increasingly distinguishing themselves on same-sex relationships. A three-stage process of religious tension appears to characterize evangelical identity-building: (1) similarity, (2) distinction, and (3) adaptation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, research testing existing public opinion theories in a social media context is scarce. This study represents arguably the first empirical examination of the spiral of silence theory in the social media environment. Through an experimental manipulation embedded in an Internet survey, respondents (N = 760) were presented with a hypothetical scenario (i.e., friendly or hostile) concerning gay bullying, an issue suited for investigation due to its moral components. Willingness to self-censor and to some extent, congruency with the national opinion climate were significant predictors of various online opinion response strategies, indicating the presence of the spiral of silence phenomenon in the social media environment. However, individual characteristics such as issue importance were related to willingness to communicate about the issue, suggesting a liberating effect on opinion expression.","[Gearhart, Sherice] Univ Nebraska, Sch Commun, Omaha, NE 68182 USA; [Gearhart, Sherice] Texas Tech Univ, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Zhang, Weiwu] Texas Tech Univ, Coll Media & Commun, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",University of Nebraska System; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Zhang, WW (corresponding author), Texas Tech Univ, MS 43082, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",sgearhart@unomaha.edu; weiwu.zhang@ttu.edu,,"Gearhart, Sherice/0000-0003-1504-4594",,,,,34,64,65,6,191,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0894-4393,1552-8286,,SOC SCI COMPUT REV,Soc.

Drawing upon national-level data and employing the theoretical construct of social identity complexity, we examine the link between Christian nationalism-representing a convergence of national and religious identities-and Americans' views toward same-sex marriage and civil unions. Multivariate analyses reveal that greater adherence to Christian nationalism is strongly and negatively related to support for both same-sex marriage and civil unions, even after controlling for political ideology, religious controls, attribution of homosexuality, and other relevant correlates. We argue that Christian nationalists, who by definition internalize a high degree of overlap between political and religious identities, are more likely to see gays and lesbians as out-groups and same-sex unions as a threat to their sense of self and community.

Tolerance toward lesbian and gay relationships has increased in almost every continent. More often than not, younger people have been at the forefront of this change. In this article, we explore explanations for this cross-national phenomenon. Specifically, we test to see whether contextual factors, those that allow lesbian women and gay men to freely express themselves or to gain cultural representation in the media, have driven this transformation. The results show that inter-cohort effects, or more liberal attitudes among younger people, are related to the pervasiveness of a nation's mass media and to the presence of press freedom. This research suggests a strong link between increasing mass support for minority rights and the factors that encourage and allow minorities to express their viewpoints to others.

Scholars have examined the question using a variety of theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence, but there is no theoretical consensus, nor are the empirical studies without methodological weaknesses. We enter this debate in an attempt to bring some clarity to the theoretical approaches, overcome some of the methodological shortcomings, and bring a yet unstudied issue area, Court decisions on gay civil rights, under scrutiny. We argue that the ability of Court decisions to influence public opinion is a function of the salience of the issue, the political context, and case specific factors at the aggregate level. At the individual level these factors are also relevant, but citizen characteristics must also be taken into consideration. Our analysis of aggregate level and individual level opinion does indeed suggest that Court decisions can influence public opinion. However, the ability of Court decisions to influence public opinion is conditional. Our findings lend support to the legitimation hypothesis and the structural effects model.

We collected period and cohort characteristics that are applicable to both of the attitudes, but specific attitude-related circumstantial conditions as well. For both attitudes, it turns out that the changing composition of Dutch society with regard to religiousness accounts for the largest changes in public opinion. Furthermore, we find that the influence of religion on both the attitude towards euthanasia and the attitude towards homosexuals became stronger over time, whereas the influence of educational attainment weakened over time.","Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Sociol, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Jaspers, E (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Sociol, POB 9104, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands.",e.jaspers@maw.ru.nl,"Jaspers, Eva/I-8078-2013; Lubbers, Marcel/C-9860-2012","Jaspers, Eva/0000-0002-8589-5899; Lubbers, Marcel/0000-0001-6295-6356; de Graaf, Nan Dirk/0000-0002-4405-4612",,,,,44,39,40,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0954-2892,,,INT J PUBLIC OPIN R,Int.

This article contributes to a better understanding of this relationship by studying attitudes of youth in two of the three largest cities of Flanders (N: 1907). The ethnic and religious heterogeneous population of these cities allows us to empirically disentangle the relevance of both religious involvement (strong versus weak) and the specific religious conviction with respect to negative attitudes towards homosexuals. This offers us a more detailed view on the exact nature of the relationship between religiosity and the latter attitudes among youth than what has been achieved so far. For both Christian and Muslim believers, we found more negative attitudes towards homosexuality, even after controlling for authoritarianism and a more traditional view on gender roles. Although boys appeared, in general, more negative towards homosexuality than girls, the gender gap amongst young Muslims was twice as large when compared to non-Muslims.","[Roggemans, Lilith] Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium; [Spruyt, Bram; Van Droogenbroeck, Filip] Vrije Univ Brussel, Sociol, Brussels, Belgium; [Keppens, Gil] Vrije Univ Brussel, Res Grp TOR, Brussels, Belgium",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Roggemans, L (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.",Lilith_roggemans@hotmail.com,"Van Droogenbroeck, Filip/AAO-3765-2020","Spruyt, Bram/0000-0003-0573-724X; Van Droogenbroeck, Filip/0000-0003-1133-3495; KEPPENS, GIL ANTOINE/0000-0001-6382-2405",,,,,80,33,33,3,83,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1103-3088,1741-3222,,YOUNG,Young,AUG,2015,23,3,,,,,254,276,,10.1177/1103308815586903,0,,,23,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary; Sociology",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics; Sociology,CN7CV,,,,,6/21/23,WOS:000358592300005,Roggemans2015,1,1,gs

Hodges, same-sex marriage remains controversial and anti-LGBT state legislation has been passed, which raises questions about whether the Supreme Court's ruling may have created a backlash. We use data from two waves of a general population survey of Nebraskans conducted before and after the decision to answer three questions. First, we test three theories of how the court decision influenced public opinion. We find that support for same-sex marriage was significantly higher following the ruling, suggesting that there was not a backlash to it. Second, we assess whether people perceive that the court accurately reflects the public's opinion. We find that people who favor same-sex marriage are more likely to think that the ruling refects public opinion very well; those who oppose same-sex marriage are more likely to think that the ruling does not at all reflect public opinion. Third, we examine the association between discussing gay rights and support for same-sex marriage, finding that those who talk about LGB issues very often are more likely to favor same-sex marriage. We discuss the implications of these findings in relation to two of the themes of this special issue: the influence of marriage equality on Americans' understandings of marriage and the impact of marriage equality on future LGBT activism.","[Kazyak, Emily] Univ Nebraska, Lincoln, NE USA; [Stange, Mathew] Math Policy Res, Sociol & Womens & Gender Studies, Lincoln, NE USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln; Mathematica,"Kazyak, E (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Dept Sociol, 725 Oldfather Hall, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.;Kazyak, E (corresponding author), Univ Nebraska, Program Womens & Gender Studies, 725 Oldfather Hall, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",ekazyak2@unl.edu,,,University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Arts & Sciences Faculty Enhancement Program,University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Arts & Sciences Faculty Enhancement Program,This work was supported by a grant from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Arts & Sciences Faculty Enhancement Program.,,90,23,23,0,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0091-8369,1540-3602,,J HOMOSEXUAL,J.

Consequently, we know little about whether, and how, this type of legislation affects public attitudes toward homosexuality. This study examines the relationship between same-sex couple legislation and public opinion using data from the World Values Survey from the years 1989 to 2014. While previous studies examining this relationship in the European context have found a positive relationship, the results presented in this paper paint a less optimistic picture of the impacts that same-sex couple legislation has on attitudes toward homosexuality. Specifically, I find that instead of same-sex partnership legislation increasing favorable attitudes across the entire population, it only affects individuals who are already generally supportive of homosexuality.

J,"Engel, SM",,,,"Engel, Stephen M.",,,Frame Spillover: Media Framing and Public Opinion of a Multifaceted LGBT Rights Agenda,LAW AND SOCIAL INQUIRY-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN BAR FOUNDATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Between May and July 2003, a shift in how the US public viewed the legality of consensual homosexual sex occurred. While in May the largest percentage of respondents to date supported decriminalizing such activity, that percentage dropped eleven points two months later. Similar declines in support were evident in the same period over a range of gay and lesbian rights claims. The ruling in Lawrence v. Texas (2003) decriminalizing homosexual sex is the obvious intervening event. To explain this pattern, coding of print and televised news coverage of the ruling throughout 2003 was undertaken. Coverage was not overtly negative in terms of antigay rhetoric or hostility toward the judiciary; rather, the dominant media frame focused on the implications of Lawrence for an entirely separate rights issue: marriage equality. This article examines the dynamic of frame spillover, or the idea that media focus on a distinct and not widely supported rights claim in a multifaceted rights agenda might depress support across the entire rights agenda. The findings call for further research, and they have implications for scholarship on public opinion, social movement framing, and ideational development and policy debate as studied within the broader field of American political development.","Bates Coll, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA",,"Engel, SM (corresponding author), Bates Coll, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA.",sengel@bates.edu,,,,,,,28,21,21,0,44,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0897-6546,,,LAW SOCIAL INQUIRY,Law Soc.

We theorize that same-sex romantic and family practices such as sexual relations, marriage, and adoption represent distinct practice types, differing in degrees of legality, cultural legitimacy, and in their internal power dynamics. Consequently, we expect that Americans view each practice type somewhat differently and their opinions on each may be influenced by religion in distinctive ways. Drawing upon national-level data, we estimate and compare the relative net effects of a comprehensive battery of religious measures on support for gay sex, marriage, and adoption, both for the full sample and across religious traditions. Analyses demonstrate that public opinion toward gay sexual relations is more strongly related to religious practice and theological conservatism compared to attitudes regarding same-sex marriage or adoption. Moreover, frequent religious practice and conservative theological beliefs about the Bible tend to be more strongly associated with attitudes toward same-sex relationships for evangelicals, compared to mainline Protestants and, to a lesser extent, Catholics. Findings ultimately affirm that the type of same-sex practice being considered (sex, marriage, or adoption) serves to moderate religions' impact on Americans' support for such practices.","[Perry, Samuel L.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Sociol, 780 Van Vleet Oval,Kaufman Hall, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Whitehead, Andrew L.] Clemson Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Clemson, SC USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; Clemson University,"Perry, SL (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Sociol, 780 Van Vleet Oval,Kaufman Hall, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",samperry2011@gmail.com,"Whitehead, Andrew/AAH-3725-2019; Whitehead, Andrew/AAG-1046-2020","Whitehead, Andrew/0000-0001-6587-0996; Perry, Samuel/0000-0002-6398-636X",,,,,39,18,18,2,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8294,1468-5906,,J SCI STUD RELIG,J.

Administrators argued that homosexuals made poor risks because of their susceptibility to blackmail, but the government has never made a strong public case for that claim. The courts rejected a charge of immorality as a legitimate basis for firing gay federal employees by the mid-1970s, but they deferred to administrative expertise on the issue of security risks even though arguments about blackmail and immorality have always been intertwined. Public opinion data from the 1990s shows that those who disapprove of homosexuality and would limit the civil liberties of gay people are much more reluctant to issue security clearances to them, providing further evidence that morality concerns work their way into at least some federal personnel decisions. Though Executive Order 13087 prohibits discriminating against federal employees on the basis of sexual orientation, the continuing high levels of disapproval of homosexuality suggest that eliminating such discrimination will be difficult.","Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Lewis, GB (corresponding author), Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",,,,,,,,25,12,12,0,5,TRANSACTION PERIOD CONSORTIUM,PISCATAWAY,"RUTGERS UNIV, DEPT 8010, 35 BERRUE CIRCLE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08854-8042 USA",1053-1858,,,J PUBL ADM RES THEOR,J.

Yet we still know little about the specific mechanisms through which religious subcultures may shape adherents' attitudes toward gays and lesbians. This study considers religious media consumption as a unique mechanism through which religious Americans are socialized and embedded within an anti-gay religious subculture. Drawing on panel data from the nationally-representative Portraits of American Life Study, and focusing on opposition to same-sex marriage as a measure of anti-gay prejudice, analyses show that more frequent consumption of religious radio and TV (but not internet) is associated with higher levels of opposition to same-sex marriage over time. These effects remain significant with different model specifications as well as controls for previous attitudes toward same-sex marriage, general media use, sociodemographic and religious characteristics, and intimate contact with gays and lesbians. We propose that consuming religious media over time may influence Americans' views toward LGBT issues directly through explicit messages about homosexuality and indirectly by embedding Americans within a broader religious subculture (largely, conservative Protestantism) that opposes homosexuality.","[Perry, Samuel L.; Snawder, Kara J.] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Sociol, 780 Van Vleet Oval,Kaufman Hall, Norman, OK 73019 USA",University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Perry, SL (corresponding author), Univ Oklahoma, Dept Sociol, 780 Van Vleet Oval,Kaufman Hall, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",samperry@ou.edu,,"Perry, Samuel/0000-0002-6398-636X",,,,,73,7,8,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1095-5143,1936-4822,,SEX CULT,Sex.

Surprisingly, it has often been assumed-but not empirically examined-that a culture of tolerance mediates the relationship between socioeconomic modernization and liberal legislation. This article closes this gap by analyzing the seventy-three countries that took part in the fifth and sixth waves of the World Values Survey. As government responsiveness to public attitudes is structurally enforced by means of electoral accountability in democracies, but not in autocracies, we, in addition, distinguish between these regime types in an analysis of moderated mediation. We show that tolerant attitudes toward homosexuals do, indeed, mediate the influence of modernization on gay and lesbian rights policies in democracies, but not in autocracies. The result is confirmed by extensive robustness checks, including an instrumental variables approach to account for a potential reverse causality between tolerance and rights. The study does not only underline the relevance of cultural aspects of modernization, but also points to the crucial importance of regime type for a translation of public opinion into policy.","[Hildebrandt, Achim; Truedinger, Eva-Maria; Wyss, Dominik] Univ Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany",University of Stuttgart,"Hildebrandt, A (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Social Sci, Breitscheidstr 2, D-70174 Stuttgart, Germany.",achim.hildebrandt@sowi.uni-stuttgart.de,,"Trudinger, Eva-Maria/0000-0003-3134-9347",,,,,65,6,6,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1065-9129,1938-274X,,POLIT RES QUART,Polit.

Despite this increase in intensity, however, the question of mass public opinion in relation to homosexual rights and practices has received almost no empirical investigation. In an effort to remedy this situation, this article focuses on both the role of respondents' gender as well as their perceptions concerning the gender of participants in a homosexual relationship (both sexes versus gay men) in distinguishing their attitudes toward the public acceptance of homosexuals and the adoption rights of lesbians and gay men. Using nationally representative data from the British Social Attitudes Surveys, we found that, whereas both respondents' gender and the gender of participants in a homosexual relationship demonstrated a significant influence on attitudes toward the public acceptance of homosexuals, they were unrelated to the adoption rights of lesbians or gay men. Even in relation to the public acceptance of homosexuals, however, gender was not the only, or even the most important, attribute in distinguishing individual opinion in this instance. Other stronger and more consistent influences were education, age, and attitudes toward either pre-marital or extra-marital sexual relations.

Though commonplace, this mode of political thinking is not inevitable. In four experiments, we show that group-centrism hinges in part on how issues are framed in public debate. When issues are framed in ways that draw attention to a policy's beneficiaries, group-centrism increases; when issues are framed in ways that deflect attention away from the beneficiaries, group-centrism declines. We conclude by drawing out the implications of these findings for the concept of frame, considered both as a rhetorical weapon in elites' hands and as a cognitive structure in citizens' minds.","UNIV MICHIGAN,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Nelson, TE (corresponding author), OHIO STATE UNIV,COLUMBUS,OH 43210, USA.",,,,,,,,80,406,407,1,59,UNIV TEXAS PRESS,AUSTIN,"BOX 7819, AUSTIN, TX 78713-7819",0022-3816,,,J POLIT,J.

We mainly focus on the explanation of differences in the disapproval of homosexuality at the individual and the national level. Data from four waves of the European Social Survey are used, using multilevel techniques to test our hypotheses. Individual differences in disapproval of homosexuality can be derived from theories of socializing agents (religious institutions, schools) and socializing circumstances as well as from psychological theories on conventionalism and tradition. We find that religious people, people who support conventionalism, and those who attach to traditions disapprove of homosexuality more, whereas highly educated people disapprove less. Differences between countries can be explained by socializing circumstances of the national context as the countries' religiosity and laws on homosexuality turned out to be important determinants of the disapproval of homosexuality. We found that disapproval of homosexuality is the least in countries where law permits homosexuals to marry. In addition, people who live in more religious countries disapprove of homosexuality more than people who live in secular countries.","[van den Akker, Hanneke; Scheepers, Peer] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Sociol, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands; [van der Ploeg, Rozemarijn] Univ Groningen, Dept Sociol, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; University of Groningen,"Scheepers, P (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Sociol, POB 9104, NL-6500 HE Nijmegen, Netherlands.",p.scheepers@maw.ru.nl,"Scheepers, Peer/C-9875-2012","Scheepers, Peer/0000-0002-9689-8139",,,,,48,133,135,1,79,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0954-2892,,,INT J PUBLIC OPIN R,Int.

In a representative telephone poll of 668 adults conducted in Singapore in September 2000, respondents were asked to indicate how likely they would be to publicly discuss two controversial issues: interracial marriage and equal rights for homosexuals. Based on the assumption that outspokenness is largely a function of a person's psychological predispositions, the proposed model for predicting outspokenness adds a variety of new predictors, such as culturally influenced self-concepts, fear of isolation, fear of authority, and communication apprehension. Other more traditional predictors of outspokenness, such as a person's perception of the opinion climate, media exposure, issue salience, and demographics, were also included in the analysis. The findings provide partial support for the spiral of silence hypothesis. That is, the respondents' perception of the future opinion climate in Singapore interacts with their assessment of how important the issue is in influencing their level of outspokenness. The findings also indicate that outspokenness is associated with respondents' self-concept of interdependence, their fear of becoming socially isolated, their communication apprehension, and their perceived importance of the issue. Media exposure, however, is not associated with outspokenness.","George Washington Univ, Sch Media & Publ Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA; Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Commun & Informat, Singapore 2263, Singapore",George Washington University; Nanyang Technological University & National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Nanyang Technological University,"Willnat, L (corresponding author), George Washington Univ, Sch Media & Publ Affairs, 805 21st St NW, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",lwillnat@gwu.edu,"Detenber, Benjamin H/K-2591-2017","Detenber, Benjamin H/0000-0002-0054-0811",,,,,44,64,67,1,50,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0954-2892,1471-6909,,INT J PUBLIC OPIN R,Int.

A number of scholarly accounts share this perspective: intense, value-laden communications, or ''critical moments,'' are of key importance in supplying people with symbolic frames for issues and, thus, in defining or redefining the value bases of issue conflict. Applying this perspective to the case of Earvin (''Magic'') Johnson's announcement that he had contracted the AIDS-causing virus-a critical moment in AIDS opinions fortuitously captured by interrupted time-series data-this analysis finds that heterosexual moral values define a new basis of polarization on AIDS-related policies among post-announcement respondents. Furthermore, an analysis of survey data obtained 10 months after ''Magic'' Johnson's disclosure reveals both persistence of the new value basis and erosion in the importance of moral evaluations of homosexuality, the ''old'' or established value that citizens have referenced in forming opinions about AIDS.",,,"POLLOCK, PH (corresponding author), UNIV CENT FLORIDA,DEPT POLIT SCI,ORLANDO,FL 32816, USA.",,,,,,,,49,38,38,0,12,UNIV TEXAS PRESS,AUSTIN,"BOX 7819, AUSTIN, TX 78713-7819",0092-5853,,,AM J POLIT SCI,Am.

This article explores whether public opinion polarisation stimulates individuals to attend lawful demonstrations. In line with relative deprivation theory, it is argued that in an environment of polarisation, individuals' normative notions are threatened, increasing the probability that they will actively participate in the political decision-making process. Using the European Social Survey from the period 2002-2014 and focusing on subnational regions, multilevel analyses are conducted. Thereby a new index to measure public opinion polarisation is introduced. Depending on the issue, empirical results confirm the effect of polarisation. While average citizens are not motivated to demonstrate over the issue of whether people from other countries are a cultural threat, they are motivated by the issues of reducing inequality and of homosexuality. The article goes on to examine in a second step whether ideological extremism makes individuals more susceptible to environmental opinion polarisation. Findings show that members of the far left are more likely to protest when their social environment is divided over the issue of income inequality. In contrast, members of the far right are motivated by rising polarisation regarding homosexuality. In sum, citizens become mobilised as their beliefs and values are threatened by public opinion polarisation.","[Kleiner, Tuuli-Marja] Univ Hagen, Dept Polit Sci, D-58084 Hagen, Germany",Fern University Hagen,"Kleiner, TM (corresponding author), Univ Hagen, Dept Polit Sci, D-58084 Hagen, Germany.",tuuli-marja.kleiner@fernuni-hagen.de,,"Kleiner, Tuuli-Marja/0000-0002-1158-7332",,,,,85,11,12,5,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0304-4130,1475-6765,,EUR J POLIT RES,Eur.

This contrasts sharply with public opinion in many of the Western European receiving countries. Using data collected shortly after migration and in a second wave one and a half years later, this contribution investigates the extent to which Polish migrants' anti-gay attitudes change over time. Focusing on four Western European countries (Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and the UK), it examines factors that act as barriers and facilitators of acculturation. We find that intention to settle permanently and greater social integration in the host country are associated with greater acculturation, while the opposite is the case for religious involvement and negative attitudes about the host society.","[Roeder, Antje] Tech Univ Chemnitz, TU Chemnitz, Inst Soziol, D-09107 Chemnitz, Germany; [Roeder, Antje] Univ Dublin Trinity Coll, Dept Sociol, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Lubbers, Marcel] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Dept Sociol, NL-6525 ED Nijmegen, Netherlands",Technische Universitat Chemnitz; Trinity College Dublin; Radboud University Nijmegen,"Roder, A (corresponding author), Tech Univ Chemnitz, Empir Sozialforsch, D-09107 Chemnitz, Germany.",antje.roeder@soziologie.tu-chemnitz.de,"Lubbers, Marcel/C-9860-2012","Lubbers, Marcel/0000-0001-6295-6356; Roder, Antje/0000-0003-0378-4739",NORFACE Research Programme on Migration,NORFACE Research Programme on Migration,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work uses data from the international project 'Socio-Cultural Integration Processes of New Immigrants in Europe' (SCIP) that was generously funded by the NORFACE Research Programme on Migration.",,46,12,13,2,32,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1468-7968,1741-2706,,ETHNICITIES,Ethnicities,APR,2016,16,2,,,SI,,261,289,,10.1177/1468796815616153,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1468796815616153,,,29,Ethnic Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Ethnic Studies,DJ0OG,,,,,6/22/23,WOS:000373903200005,,4,2,gs
