@article{Tankard2017,
	abstract = {We propose that institutions such as the U.S. Supreme Court can lead
   individuals to update their perceptions of social norms, in contrast to
   the mixed evidence on whether institutions shape individuals' personal
   opinions. We studied reactions to the June 2015 U.S. Supreme Court
   ruling in favor of same-sex marriage. In a controlled experimental
   setting, we found that a favorable ruling, when presented as likely,
   shifted perceived norms and personal attitudes toward increased support
   for gay marriage and gay people. Next, a five-wave longitudinal
   time-series study using a sample of 1,063 people found an increase in
   perceived social norms supporting gay marriage after the ruling but no
   change in personal attitudes. This pattern was replicated in a separate
   between-subjects data set. These findings provide the first experimental
   evidence that an institutional decision can change perceptions of social
   norms, which have been shown to guide behavior, even when individual
   opinions are unchanged.},

	abstract = {Data from a 1999 national telephone survey with a probability sample of
   English-speaking U.S. adults (N = 1,335) were used to assess how support
   for Hiv surveillance policies is related to AIDS stigma and negative
   attitudes toward groups disproportionately affected by the epidemic.
   Anonymous reporting of Hiv results to the government was supported by a
   margin of approximately 2-to-1, but name-based reporting was opposed
   3-to-1. Compared with other respondents, supporters of name-based
   surveillance expressed significantly more negative feelings toward
   people with AIDS, gay men, lesbians, and injecting drug users. More than
   one third of all respondents reported that concerns about AIDS stigma
   would affect their own decision to be tested for Hiv in the future.
   Implications for understanding the social construction of illness and
   for implementing effective Hiv surveillance programs are discussed.},

	abstract = {Using data from a national probability sample of heterosexual U.S.
   adults (N=2,281), the present study describes the distribution and
   correlates of men's and women's attitudes toward transgender people.
   Feeling thermometer ratings of transgender people were strongly
   correlated with attitudes toward gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals, but
   were significantly less favorable. Attitudes toward transgender people
   were more negative among heterosexual men than women. Negative attitudes
   were associated with endorsement of a binary conception of gender;
   higher levels of psychological authoritarianism, political conservatism,
   and anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity; and lack of
   personal contact with sexual minorities. In regression analysis, sexual
   prejudice accounted for much of the variance in transgender attitudes,
   but respondent gender, educational level, authoritarianism,
   anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity remained significant
   predictors with sexual prejudice statistically controlled. Implications
   and directions for future research on attitudes toward transgender
   people are discussed.},

@article{Frost2016,
	abstract = {This article reports a study of the function and composition of social
   support networks among diverse lesbian, gay, and bisexual (Lgb) men and
   women (n = 396) in comparison to their heterosexual peers (n = 128).
   Data were collected using a structured social support network matrix in
   a community sample recruited in New York City. Our findings show that
   gay and bisexual men may rely on ``chosen families{''} more than lesbian
   and bisexual women. Both heterosexuals and Lgbs relied less on family
   and more on other people (e.g., friends, coworkers) for everyday social
   support (e.g., recreational and social activities, talking about
   problems). Providers of everyday social support were most often of the
   same sexual orientation and race/ethnicity as participants. In seeking
   major support (e.g., borrowing large sums of money), heterosexual men
   and women along with lesbian and bisexual women relied primarily on
   their families, but gay and bisexual men relied primarily on other Lgb
   individuals. Racial/ethnic minority Lgbs relied on Lgb similar others at
   the same rate as did White Lgbs but, notably, racial/ethnic minority
   Lgbs reported receiving fewer dimensions of support.},

@article{Price2005,
	abstract = {Although the framing of public opinion has often been conceptualized as
   a collective and social process, experimental studies of framing have
   typically examined only individual, psychological responses to
   alternative message frames. In this research we employ for the first
   time group conversations as the unit of analysis (following Gamson 1992)
   in an experimental study of framing effects. Two hundred and thirty-five
   American citizens in 50 groups (17 homo-geneously conservative groups,
   15 homogeneously liberal groups, and 18 heterogeneous groups) discussed
   whether or not gay and lesbian partnerships should be legally
   recognized. Groups were randomly assigned to one of two framing
   conditions (a ``homosexual marriage/special rights{''} frame or a
   ``civil union/equal rights{''} frame). Results indicated framing effects
   that were, in all cases, contingent on the ideological leanings of the
   group. The ``marriage{''} frame tended to polarize group discussions
   along ideological lines. Both liberal and conservative groups appeared
   to find their opponents' frame more provocative, responding to them with
   a larger number of statements and expressing greater ambivalence than
   when reacting to more hospitable frames.},

@article{Lindaman2002,
	abstract = {Using the issue evolution framework, our research examines partisan
   polarization on several culture war issues, including pornography,
   environment, gun control, and gay civil rights. We look for evidence of
   partisan polarization among political elites and citizens, as well as
   examine top-down versus bottom-up paths of influence among Republicans
   and Democrats. Data from the General Social Survey and congressional
   roll-call votes between 1970-1999 are analyzed. Our results suggest that
   although partisan elites have become increasingly polarized on culture
   war issues, mass partisans have not followed suit across all issues.
   Only on environmental and gun control issues do we find significant
   evidence of issue evolution, including a linkage between elite and mass
   opinion. We conclude that culture war issues may not be as prone to
   issue evolution as previous research has indicated, in part because
   these issues are not all equally salient to the mass public.},

	abstract = {Several studies have examined the attitudes of heterosexuals towards
   lesbian and gay parenting, revealing mostly negative attitudes.
   Nonetheless, no research studies have examined these attitudes
   specifically among elderly adults. Two hundred eighty older
   heterosexuals adults ranged from 65 to 87 years old (women: M = 74.2, Sd
   = 6.0; male M = 73.9, Sd = 6.1) completed measures evaluating their
   knowledge of the existence of lesbian and gay parents, their attitudes
   towards lesbian and gay parenting and expected child outcomes, and
   opinions regarding legalization and recognition of lesbian and gay
   parents. As we expected, age was a relevant predictor of negative
   attitudes towards lesbian and gay parenting: older elders had a stronger
   prejudice than the others. Data revealed that the more positive
   evaluation was for the heterosexual and lesbian parents while the more
   negative evaluation was for the gay male parents. Regression analyses
   showed that a negative attitude towards lesbian and gay parents was
   predicted by older age, right-wing conservatism, and internalized sexual
   stigma. The expected effects on child outcomes were predicted only by
   the dimensions of sexual stigma.},

	abstract = {What are the effects of judicial action and policy implementation on
   attitude change? The previous literature indicates that attitudes may
   change, but there is some debate about its direction. According to some
   theories, legislation or litigation should strike a backlash, resulting
   in greater disapproval of the issue. Other perspectives contend that
   these acts reflect consensus, legitimate, or polarize the issue. We
   analyze panel data on attitudes toward same-sex marriage and feelings
   toward lesbians and gay men. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court made
   historic decisions on same-sex marriage, and residents in some states
   had same-sex marriage legalized. Given this variation, we decompose the
   multiple pathways attitudes change among residents in different policy
   contexts over time. We find that residents of states that had same-sex
   marriage policy introduced had the greatest reduction of anti-gay
   attitudes. We consider consensus and legitimacy as most applicable and
   provide minimal indication of backlash or polarization.},

@article{Flores2015,
	abstract = {Transgender people face an uncertain legal climate, and efforts to
   include gender identity in policies have been met with both successes
   and failures. These policies are often developed in the legislative
   process, which directly involve public opinion. To date, there is only
   one study analyzing American public attitudes toward transgender people.
   This research gap makes it unclear whether people in general understand
   what transgender means and whether public support for transgender rights
   depends on understanding and knowing transgender people. Since the
   population of transgender people is estimated to be smaller than that of
   lesbian, gay, and bisexual people, examining whether and how having a
   friend or family member who is lesbian or gay relates to transgender
   rights is important to understand political coalitions and attitude
   change. This study examines public attitudes about transgender rights in
   the Usa. It finds that as respondents report being more informed about
   transgender people they tend to have more supportive attitudes.
   Interpersonal contact with someone who is lesbian or gay also leads to a
   secondary transfer of positive attitudes. About half of the secondary
   transfer effect operates through a mechanism of attitude generalization:
   contact positively affects the opinions people have on gay rights that
   then broaden to affect attitudes on transgender rights. Demographic
   characteristics also indicate that predictors of transgender attitudes
   are similar to previous studies regarding attitudes toward lesbians, gay
   men, and bisexuals. Further survey efforts need to consider inquiring
   about transgender rights and attitudes, as this remains a research gap
   in need of scholarly understanding.},

   positive and negative attitudes about important political issues. In
   this article, we review the concept of attitudinal ambivalence and
   propose a survey-based measure of ambivalence adapted from the
   experimental literature. Extending our earlier work on abortion,
   analysis of a statewide telephone survey of Florida residents reveals
   that (1) many people have ambivalent attitudes about issues related to
   gay and lesbian rights; (2) the amount of ambivalence varies according
   to the specific rights in question (military service, gay marriage and
   adoption, membership in youth organizations such as Boy Scouts, and
   others); (3) ambivalence on gay rights is to some extent a function of
   conflict among citizens' underlying core values; and (4) under certain
   circumstances, ambivalence appears to mediate the relationship between a
   person's issue preferences with regard to gay rights and his or her
   evaluation of political leaders and institutions.},

@article{Bishin2016,
	abstract = {One long-recognized consequence of the tension between popular
   sovereignty and democratic values like liberty and equality is public
   opinion backlash, which occurs when individuals recoil in response to
   some salient event. For decades, scholars have suggested that opinion
   backlash impedes policy gains by marginalized groups. Public opinion
   research, however, suggests that widespread attitude change that
   backlash proponents theorize is likely to be rare. Examining backlash
   against gays and lesbians using a series of online and natural
   experiments about marriage equality, and large-sample survey data, we
   find no evidence of opinion backlash among the general public, by
   members of groups predisposed to dislike gays and lesbians, or from
   those with psychological traits that may predispose them to lash back.
   The important implication is that groups pursuing rights should not be
   dissuaded by threats of backlash that will set their movement back in
   the court of public opinion.},

   first empirical examination of the spiral of silence theory in the

   Willingness to self-censor and to some extent, congruency with the
   national opinion climate were significant predictors of various online
   opinion response strategies, indicating the presence of the spiral of
   silence phenomenon in the social media environment. However, individual
   characteristics such as issue importance were related to willingness to

	abstract = {Religion and anti-gay prejudice in the United States are closely
   connected. Yet we still know little about the specific mechanisms
   through which religious subcultures may shape adherents' attitudes
   toward gays and lesbians. This study considers religious media
   consumption as a unique mechanism through which religious Americans are
   socialized and embedded within an anti-gay religious subculture. Drawing
   on panel data from the nationally-representative Portraits of American
   Life Study, and focusing on opposition to same-sex marriage as a measure
   of anti-gay prejudice, analyses show that more frequent consumption of
   religious radio and Tv (but not internet) is associated with higher
   levels of opposition to same-sex marriage over time. These effects
   remain significant with different model specifications as well as
   controls for previous attitudes toward same-sex marriage, general media
   use, sociodemographic and religious characteristics, and intimate
   contact with gays and lesbians. We propose that consuming religious
   media over time may influence Americans' views toward Lgbt issues
   directly through explicit messages about homosexuality and indirectly by
   embedding Americans within a broader religious subculture (largely,
   conservative Protestantism) that opposes homosexuality.},

	abstract = {Public opinion research has repeatedly shown that religious persons
   report more prejudice against homosexuality when compared to their
   non-religious counterparts. This article contributes to a better
   understanding of this relationship by studying attitudes of youth in two
   of the three largest cities of Flanders (N: 1907). The ethnic and
   religious heterogeneous population of these cities allows us to
   empirically disentangle the relevance of both religious involvement
   (strong versus weak) and the specific religious conviction with respect
   to negative attitudes towards homosexuals. This offers us a more
   detailed view on the exact nature of the relationship between
   religiosity and the latter attitudes among youth than what has been
   achieved so far. For both Christian and Muslim believers, we found more
   negative attitudes towards homosexuality, even after controlling for
   authoritarianism and a more traditional view on gender roles. Although
   boys appeared, in general, more negative towards homosexuality than
   girls, the gender gap amongst young Muslims was twice as large when
   compared to non-Muslims.},

@article{Barth2009,
	abstract = {Just after three in four Arkansas voters endorsed a state constitutional
   amendment barring state recognition of same-sex marriages, a
   comprehensive state-level survey allowed a closer look into the
   attitudes of Arkansans on a variety of gay- and lesbian-related issues.
   When placed in the context of Arkansas's political culture and
   ideological patters, this serves as a case study of the relationship
   between public opinion, specific policy issues, and the diffusion (or
   nondiffusion) of policies in an individual state.
   The 2005 Arkansas Poll included a battery of questions gauging citizens'
   attitudes on gay/lesbian individuals and the morality of same-sex
   relations, same-sex partner recognition, bans on gay adoption and foster
   parenting, bans on gays openly serving in the U.S. military, and
   expansion of civil rights laws to bar discrimination on the basis of
   sexual orientation, among other policies. This article reports those
   survey results and employs regression/logistic analysis in analyzing
   them.
   The results reveal that while Arkansans are uncomfortable with
   homosexuality, they are surprisingly hesitant to prescribe
   state-sanctioned discrimination.
   This tightrope between libertarianism and angst about homosexuality that
   resulted in policy nondiffusion until three years after the data
   reported here is reflective of the state's political culture, which
   combines traditionalistic and individualistic elements.},

   A closer examination, however, showed that exposure to the frames
   encouraged participants to use value language not only in ways suggested
   by the frames but also in ways that challenged the frames. Moreover, the
   results indicated that exposure to the ``morality{''} frame interfered
   with the impact of the ``equality{''} frame, suggesting that the

Using national surveys and advances in opinion estimation, we create new estimates of state-level support for eight policies, including civil unions and nondiscrimination laws. We differentiate between responsiveness to opinion and congruence with opinion majorities. We find a high degree of responsiveness, controlling for interest group pressure and the ideology of voters and elected officials. Policy salience strongly increases the influence of policy-specific opinion (directly and relative to general voter ideology). There is, however, a surprising amount of noncongruence: for some policies, even clear supermajority support seems insufficient for adoption. When noncongruent, policy tends to be more conservative than desired by voters; that is, there is little progay policy bias. We find little to no evidence that state political institutions affect policy responsiveness or congruence. },

We present the first systematic assessment of the predictive accuracy of each and give practical advice about when and how each method should be used. To do so, we use an original data set of over 100 surveys on gay rights issues as well as 1988 presidential election data. Under optimal conditions, both methods work well, but multilevel modeling performs better generally. Compared to baseline opinion measures, it yields smaller errors, higher correlations, and more reliable estimates. Multilevel modeling is clearly superior when samples are smaller---indeed, one can accurately estimate state opinion using only a single large national survey. This greatly expands the scope of issues for which researchers can study subnational opinion directly or as an influence on policymaking.},

   two values-egalitarianism and traditional morality-on American public
   opinion about gay rights and whether media framing accounts for the role
   that knowledge has played. An analysis of mass media coverage during the
   peak years of the debate over gay rights (1990-97) showed that the
   implications of moral traditionalism were virtually undisputed in this
   debate, whereas both sides laid claim to egalitarianism. Analysis of
   American National Election Studies survey data demonstrated that in 1992
   and 1996 the impact of moral traditionalism on public opinion grew
   stronger as political knowledge increased, whereas the impact of
   egalitarianism did not vary across levels of knowledge. Thus, the
   results suggest that the extent to which political knowledge moderates a
   value's effect on opinion can depend on whether public debate provides
   an undisputed frame or competing frames for that value. One could, in
   turn, frame the implications of this finding for democratic politics in
   more than one way.},

	abstract = {Using General Social Survey data from 1973 to 1998, changing American
   attitudes toward homosexuality are examined. Two hypotheses are tested:
   (1) Can changes in attitudes be accounted for by the changing
   demographics of the population? (2) Are changing attitudes toward
   homosexuality embedded within larger cultural ideological shifts? The
   data indicate that Americans distinguish between the morality of
   homosexuality and the civil liberties of homosexuals. Americans became
   increasingly negative regarding the morality of homosexuality through
   1990, but since then their attitudes have become increasingly liberal.
   The same 25-year period witnessed a steady decline in Americans'
   willingness to restrict the civil libel-ties of homosexuals. Changes in
   American demographics-particularly increasing educational levels-and
   changing cultural ideological beliefs can account for only about
   one-half of the change over time in attitudes toward homosexuality.
   Several theories are put forth to explain these patterns of change and

	abstract = {Using data from a 1999 national Rdd survey (N=1,335), this article
   examines gender gaps in heterosexuals' attitudes toward lesbians, gay
   men, and a variety of topics related to homosexuality. Attitudes toward
   lesbians differed from attitudes toward gay men in several areas, and
   significant differences were observed between male and female
   heterosexual respondents. Survey participants generally were more likely
   to regard gay men as mentally ill, supported adoption rights for
   lesbians more than for gay men, and had more negative personal reactions
   to gay men than to lesbians. Overall, heterosexual women were more
   supportive than men of employment protection and adoption rights for gay
   people, more willing to extend employee benefits to same-sex couples,
   and less likely to hold stereotypical beliefs about gay people.
   Heterosexual men's negative reactions to gay men were at the root of
   these gender differences. of all respondent-by-target combinations,
   heterosexual men were the least supportive of recognition of same-sex
   relationships and adoption rights for gay men, most likely to believe
   that gay men are mentally ill and molest children, and most negative in
   their affective reactions to gay men. Heterosexual men's response
   patterns were affected by item order, suggesting possible gender
   differences in the cognitive organization of attitudes toward gay men
   and lesbians. The findings demonstrate the importance of differentiating
   lesbians from gay men as attitude targets in survey research.},

	abstract = {Across the globe, the debate over homosexuality continues, with great
   variation in public opinion about the acceptability of homosexuality,
   laws regulating same-sex unions and penalties for homosexual sex
   behaviors. Religion is often seen as an important predictor of attitudes
   about homosexuality. However, cross-national differences in cultural
   orientations suggest that the role religion has in explaining homosexual
   attitudes may depend on a nation's cultural context. In this study, we
   merge ideas from cultural sociology and religious contextual effects to
   explain cross-national variation in public opinion about homosexuality.
   Using data from the fourth wave of the World Values Survey and
   Hierarchical Modeling techniques, we find support for the micro and
   macro effects of religion and a survival vs. self-expressive cultural
   orientation. Moreover, we find that personal religious beliefs have a
   greater effect on attitudes about homosexuality in countries like the
   United States, which have a strong self-expressive cultural orientation.

@article{Olson2006,
	abstract = {Objective. The goal of this article is to analyze the relationship
   between religion, measured in terms of religious affiliation and
   religiosity, and public opinion about same-sex marriage, civil unions,
   and a federal constitutional amendment that would prohibit gay marriage.
   Methods. We use logistic regression with calculated standardized
   coefficients to analyze data from a nationally representative survey of
   1,610 respondents conducted in March-April 2004. Results. Religious
   variables perform better than demographic measures in models of
   attitudes about same-sex unions. Non-Protestants are much more likely to
   support same-sex unions than are Protestants, and individuals with
   conservative attitudes toward morality and secularism and (to a lesser
   extent) those who participate actively in religious life are more likely
   to oppose such unions. On the whole, religious variables play a weaker
   role in predicting support for a constitutional amendment to prevent gay
   marriage than they do in predicting attitudes toward same-sex unions.

   attitudes about same-sex unions. Moreover, homosexuality appears to be a

	abstract = {Black homophobia has been cited as a contributing factor in slowing
   mobilization against AIDS in the African-American community, as an
   obstacle to black lesbians and gay men in coming to terms with their
   sexuality, and as a challenge to the legitimacy of the gay rights
   movement. Yet evidence that blacks are more homophobic than whites is
   quite limited. This article uses responses from almost seven thousand
   blacks and forty-three thousand whites in 31 surveys conducted since
   1973 to give more definitive answers on black-white attitudinal
   differences and their demographic roots. Despite their greater
   disapproval of homosexuality, blacks' opinions on sodomy laws, gay civil
   liberties, and employment discrimination are quite similar to whites'
   opinions, and African Americans are more likely to support laws
   prohibiting antigay discrimination. Once religious and educational
   differences are controlled, blacks remain more disapproving of
   homosexuality but are moderately more supportive of gay civil liberties
   and markedly more opposed to antigay employment discrimination than are
   whites. Yet religion, education, gender, and age all have weaker impacts
   on black than on white attitudes, suggesting that black and white
   attitudes have different roots.},

   Survey and national statistics for 35 countries, this article builds on
   the postmaterialist thesis by assessing the impact of economic
   inequality across and within nations on attitudes toward homosexuality.
   It provides evidence that tolerance tends to decline as national income
   inequality rises. For professionals and managers, the results also
   support the postmaterialist argument that economic development leads to
   more tolerant attitudes. On the other hand, attitudes of the working
   class are generally less tolerant, and contrary to expectations of the
   postmaterialist thesis, are seemingly unaffected by economic
   development. In other words, economic development influences attitudes
   only for those who benefit most. These findings have political
   implications, suggesting that state policies that have the goal of
   economic growth but fail to consider economic inequality may contribute
   to intolerant social and political values, an attribute widely

   to examine beliefs about the origins of homosexuality. If the cause of
   homosexuality is perceived as controllable (learned, environmental, or
   an individual choice), negative affect toward homosexuals and reduced
   support for policies relevant to the group can be expected. If the cause
   is perceived as uncontrollable (biological or genetic in origin),
   positive affect and increased support for polices is anticipated. Our
   analyses of data from two unique surveys of national adults corroborate
   these hypotheses, showing that positive feelings toward gays, support
   for gay civil rights, civil unions, and same-sex marriage are strongly
   determined by a genetic attribution for homosexuality. Attributions are
   in fact the strongest predictor of support. We distinguish our analysis

	abstract = {This research note examines changes in attitudes toward same-sex
   marriage over time. Using Ols regression and decomposition techniques to
   analyze General Social Survey data, I explain individuals' attitudes
   toward same-sex marriage from 1988 to 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010. The
   influences on same-sex marriage attitudes differed substantially over
   time. Many of the characteristics commonly thought to increase
   opposition to same-sex marriage (including being African American,
   living in the southern United States, being an evangelical Protestant,
   and being Republican) are associated with attitudes only in the later
   years. In 1988, opposition was generally much higher for everyone; most
   respondents expressed at least some to strong disapproval of same-sex
   marriage in 1988, which was then reduced for the highly educated, urban
   residents, and those with less conservative or no religious
   affiliations. That is, support for same-sex marriage was fairly
   localized to specific subgroups in 1988. But, by 2010, support for
   same-sex marriage was much more broad-based, and opposition to same-sex
   marriage became more localized to specific subgroupsolder Americans,
   southerners, African Americans, evangelical Protestants, and
   Republicans. The decomposition analysis finds that changing same-sex
   marriage attitudes are not due to demographic changes in the American
   population. Rather, the liberalization in same-sex marriage attitudes
   from 1988 to 2010 is due primarily to a general societal change in
   attitudes, as is evidenced by the large change in the constant. Taken
   together, the results suggest that changing attitudes toward same-sex
   marriage reflect a cultural shift.},

	abstract = {The article first describes how the principle of non-discrimination of
   homosexuals is anchored in Eu legislation and influences concrete
   policies of the European Union. Against this background, the second
   section analyses citizens' attitudes towards homosexuality and whether
   there are differences among the 27 Eu member states and Turkey. The
   descriptive findings show that there are substantial differences at the
   national and individual level in the degree to which citizens think of
   homosexuality as acceptable. A sense that homosexuality is justifiable
   is particularly low in recently acceded countries and is almost
   non-existent in Turkey. Modernization theorists have argued that
   economic development influences the value orientation of the citizens.
   Other scholars have claimed that values are strongly influenced by the
   religious heritage of a country. Using multilevel analysis, the study
   tests to what extent modernization factors and/or religious factors
   influence citizens' attitudes towards non-discrimination of
   homosexuality. According to the results of the causal analysis,
   modernization theory and cultural heritage theory contribute to
   explaining attitudes towards homosexuality. All the hypotheses derived
   from the two theories are supported by the statistical analysis.},

	abstract = {Objective
   We examine racial differences in support for same-sex marriage, and test
   whether the emerging black-white gap is a function of religiosity. We
   explore how religious factors play a crucial role in racial differences,
   and how secular factors have varying effects on attitudes for whites and
   African Americans.
   Methods
   Using data from the General Social Surveys, we estimate ordinal logistic
   regression models and stacked structural equation models.
   Results
   We show that the racial divide is a function of African Americans' ties
   to sectarian Protestant religious denominations and high rates of church
   attendance. We also show racial differences in the influence of
   education and political values on opposition to same sex marriage.
   Conclusions
   Religious factors are a source of racial differences in support for
   same-sex marriage, and secular influences play less of a role in
   structuring African Americans' beliefs about same-sex marriage.},

   is one component) negatively affect health-related outcomes. However,
   few studies have examined structural stigma related to sexual minority
   status as a risk factor for Hiv outcomes among Msm.Methods:In August
   2013, members of a large Msm social and sexual networking site in the
   United States completed a survey about Hiv-prevention practices. A
   previously validated composite index provided values for state-level
   structural stigma, including density of same-sex couples, proportion of
   public high schools with Gay-Straight Alliances, state laws protecting
   sexual minorities, and public opinion toward homosexuality.
   Multivariable logistic generalized estimating equations assessed the
   relationship between structural stigma and condomless anal intercourse,
   use and awareness of antiretroviral-based Hiv-prevention strategies
   (i.e. pre and postexposure prophylaxis, or Pep and PrEp), and comfort
   discussing male-male sex with primary care providers.Results:Among the
   4098 Hiv-uninfected Msm, lower state-level structural stigma was
   associated with decreased odds of condomless anal intercourse
   {[}adjusted odds ratio (aOr) 0.97 per one unit increase in structural
   stigma score, 95\% confidence interval (Ci) 0.94-0.99], increased odds
   of awareness of Pep (aOr 1.06, 95\% Ci 1.02-1.09), and PrEp (aOr 1.06,
   95\% Ci 1.02-1.10), having taken Pep (aOr 1.15, 95\% Ci 1.05-1.26) and
   PrEp (aOr 1.21, 95\% Ci 1.01-1.44), and comfort discussing male-male sex
   with providers (aOr 1.08, 95\% Ci 1.05-1.11), after adjusting for social
   and state-level confounders.Conclusion:Msm living in more stigmatizing
   environments had decreased use of antiretroviral-based Hiv-prevention
   strategies compared to those in less stigmatizing environments. Legal
   reforms protecting sexual minorities should be evaluated as structural
   interventions that could reduce Hiv risk among Msm.},

   Past research reveals how religion and opinions about the cause of
   homosexuality influence attitudes concerning same-sex unions. No study
   to date contains a comprehensive collection of religion measures while
   also accounting for views of the cause of homosexuality. Therefore, this
   study investigates the extent to which religion predicts certain
   attribution beliefs as well as attitudes toward same-sex unions while
   controlling for attribution beliefs.
   Method
   The Baylor Religion Survey (2007) is used to estimate binary logistic
   models predicting the effects of religion and attribution beliefs on
   attitudes toward same-sex unions.
   Findings
   First, religion is strongly associated with the belief that homosexuals
   choose their sexual orientation. Second, religion maintains a
   significant association with attitudes toward same-sex unions despite
   inclusion of an attribution variable.
   Conclusion
   Even if a biological explanation for homosexuality is ultimately proven,
   unfavorable attitudes toward same-sex unions will most likely endure due
   to religion's persistent effect.},

   industrialized societies, with or without same-sex marriage. In this
   article, we analyze data of the five waves of the European Social Survey
   for the period 2002-2010. Results show that levels of prejudice are
   significantly lower in countries that recognize same-sex marriage, while
   levels are only slightly lower in countries with some form of registered
   partnership for gay and lesbian couples. Therefore, we can assume that
   same-sex marriage is indeed an issue affecting public opinion and public
   policy.},

   coming out to straight friends and family members should increase
   acceptance of homosexuality and support for gay rights. If lesbians, gay
   men, and bisexuals (Lgbs) come out primarily to people they expect to be
   accepting, however, the repeated finding that people who know Lgbs are
   more likely to support gay rights could be overstating the impact of
   coming out. Using individual-level data from 27 national surveys, I find
   that similar variables predict both knowing Lgbs and supporting gay
   rights, but in different ways. Even after controlling for those
   demographic, religious, and political variables-and sometimes also for
   beliefs about whether some people are born gay and whether homosexuality
   is immoral-people who know Lgbs are much more likely to support gay
   rights. The effect holds for every issue, in every year, for every type

@article{Doan2014,
	abstract = {Attitudes toward gay rights have liberalized over the past few decades,
   but scholars know less about the extent to which individuals in the
   United States exhibit subtle forms of prejudice toward lesbians and
   gays. To help address this issue, we offer a conceptualization of formal
   rights and informal privileges. Using original data from a nationally
   representative survey experiment, we examine whether people distinguish
   between formal rights (e.g., partnership benefits) and informal
   privileges (e.g., public displays of affection) in their attitudes
   toward same-sex couples. Results show that heterosexuals are as willing
   to extend formal rights to same-sex couples as they are to unmarried
   heterosexual couples. However, they are less willing to grant informal
   privileges. Lesbians and gays are more willing to extend formal rights
   to same-sex couples, but they too are sometimes more supportive of
   informal privileges for heterosexual couples. We also find that
   heterosexuals' attitudes toward marriage more closely align with their
   attitudes toward informal privileges than formal rights, whereas
   lesbians and gays view marriage similarly to both formal rights and
   informal privileges. Our findings highlight the need to examine multiple
   dimensions of sexual prejudice to help understand how informal types of
   prejudice persist as minority groups receive formal rights.},

   public opinion toward homosexuality and gay rights in Great Britain in
   the postwar period. Three broad sets of indicators are examined: general
   attitudes toward homosexuality; acceptability of homosexuals in

   overwhelmingly negative in the 1940s and 1950s but started to liberalize
   following the decriminalization of homosexuality in 1967. Attitudes
   suffered a temporary setback with the advent of AIDS in the mid-1980s,

   millennium, especially during the second half of the first decade of the
   2000s, culminating in the successful campaign for legalization of
   same-sex marriage in England and Wales. This trend toward liberalization
   has direct parallels in growing public support for several other facets

@article{Reynolds2013,
	abstract = {This article focuses on the link between the representation of lesbian,
   gay, bisexual, and transgender (Lgbt) people in national legislatures
   and the existence of equality laws focused on sexual orientation. It
   addresses three interrelated questions: how many ``out{''} Lgbt
   legislators have served in national parliaments, what explains the
   cross-national variation in their legislative presence, and what is the
   relationship between the presence of gay legislators and the enactment
   of laws that treat gay and straight citizens equally? There is an
   established literature arguing that the representation of women and
   ethnic minorities ``descriptively{''} in national legislatures improves
   the realization of their policy preferences and the position of the
   group within the society as a whole. This article draws on that
   literature and extends the analysis to Lgbt communities. It finds that
   the presence of even a small number of openly gay legislators is
   associated significantly with the future passage of enhanced gay rights,
   even after including controls for social values, democracy, government
   ideology, and electoral system design. Once openly gay legislators are
   in office they have a transformative effect on the views and voting
   behavior of their straight colleagues. This ``familiarity through
   presence{''} effect is echoed in studies of U.S. state legislatures and
   levels of social tolerance of homosexuality in the population at large.},

@article{Baunach2011,
	abstract = {Objective
   The objective of this article is to examine the trend in attitudes
   toward gay marriage through the analysis of data from the General Social
   Survey.
   Methods
   Using linear decomposition techniques, I explain the change in attitudes
   toward gay marriage from 1988 to 2006.
   Results
   Attitudes significantly liberalized over time; 71 percent opposed gay
   marriage in 1988, but by 2006, this figure dropped to 52 percent.
   Approximately two-thirds of this change was due to an intracohort change
   effect, or individuals' modifying their views over time, and one-third
   was due to a cohort succession effect, or later cohorts replacing
   earlier ones. This pattern was replicated across many subgroups of the
   U.S. public, including age, sex, residential, educational, and religious
   groups.
   Conclusion
   The results suggest that the use of the ``equality/tolerance{''} framing
   of gay marriage by its supporters and other societal events or
   ``moments{''} may have convinced some people who used to disapprove of
   gay marriage in 1988 to approve of it by 2006.},

@article{Schnabel2016,
	abstract = {This study uses General Social Survey data to compare gender and
   homosexuality across American religious groups from the 1970s to 2014,
   examining three possible patterns for how evangelical attitudes relate
   to those of other groups: (I) they are similar; (2) they are different,
   but move together over time; (3) they are different and converge or
   diverge over time. Evangelical gender attitudes regarding work and
   family issues are more conservative than those of all other groups, but
   are adaptive to broad trends, changing at a rate similar to those of
   other groups. Evangelical attitudes toward the morality of homosexuality
   and same-sex marriage are more conservative than those of all other
   religious groups, and their rate of change is slower over time. Separate
   trends on the two issues suggest that gender and sexuality attitude
   change is decoupled, especially among evangelicals who are adapting more
   on gender while increasingly distinguishing themselves on same-sex
   relationships. A three-stage process of religious tension appears to
   characterize evangelical identity-building: (1) similarity, (2)
   distinction, and (3) adaptation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

@article{Whitehead2015,
	abstract = {How do overlapping social identities shape Americans' views toward
   contemporary social and moral issues? Drawing upon national-level data
   and employing the theoretical construct of social identity complexity,
   we examine the link between Christian nationalism-representing a
   convergence of national and religious identities-and Americans' views
   toward same-sex marriage and civil unions. Multivariate analyses reveal
   that greater adherence to Christian nationalism is strongly and
   negatively related to support for both same-sex marriage and civil
   unions, even after controlling for political ideology, religious
   controls, attribution of homosexuality, and other relevant correlates.
   We argue that Christian nationalists, who by definition internalize a
   high degree of overlap between political and religious identities, are
   more likely to see gays and lesbians as out-groups and same-sex unions
   as a threat to their sense of self and community. We conclude by
   discussing the implications of this study for future research on
   political and religious identities and intolerance toward socially
   marginalized populations.},

@article{Ayoub2017,
	abstract = {Global attitudes involving homosexuality are changing rapidly. Tolerance
   toward lesbian and gay relationships has increased in almost every
   continent. More often than not, younger people have been at the
   forefront of this change. In this article, we explore explanations for
   this cross-national phenomenon. Specifically, we test to see whether
   contextual factors, those that allow lesbian women and gay men to freely
   express themselves or to gain cultural representation in the media, have
   driven this transformation. The results show that inter-cohort effects,
   or more liberal attitudes among younger people, are related to the
   pervasiveness of a nation's mass media and to the presence of press
   freedom. This research suggests a strong link between increasing mass
   support for minority rights and the factors that encourage and allow
   minorities to express their viewpoints to others. These findings have
   broad implications, in that they help us understand the growing global
   acceptance around gay rights.},

@article{Stoutenborough2006,
	abstract = {The theoretical and empirical debate over the ability of the U.S.
   Supreme Court to influence public opinion through its decisions is far
   from settled. Scholars have examined the question using a variety of
   theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence, but there is no
   theoretical consensus, nor are the empirical studies without
   methodological weaknesses. We enter this debate in an attempt to bring
   some clarity to the theoretical approaches, overcome some of the
   methodological shortcomings, and bring a yet unstudied issue area, Court
   decisions on gay civil rights, under scrutiny. We argue that the ability
   of Court decisions to influence public opinion is a function of the
   salience of the issue, the political context, and case specific factors
   at the aggregate level. At the individual level these factors are also
   relevant, but citizen characteristics must also be taken into
   consideration. Our analysis of aggregate level and individual level
   opinion does indeed suggest that Court decisions can influence public
   opinion. However, the ability of Court decisions to influence public
   opinion is conditional. Our findings lend support to the legitimation
   hypothesis and the structural effects model. We conclude with a
   discussion of the implications of our findings and suggestions for
   future research.},
